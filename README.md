We are proud to present our CCAPDEV Project, designed by Mauries, Benmar, and Nathan. Our project aims to improve the existing scheduling system for the Arrows Express Shuttle, introducing innovative features and a user-friendly profile system for ease-of-access.
With our collective expertise and passion for creating efficient solutions, we have developed a platform that enhances the shuttle-commuting experience of students, faculty, and staff at De La Salle University. Our project incorporates the concept of a profile system, allowing users to easily manage their reservations and personalize their shuttle experience.
We are dedicated to providing reliable and convenient ways to access shuttle services that align with the hard work and dedication of the DLSU community. By simplifying the scheduling process and introducing user-friendly features, we aim to ensure a comfortable and stress-free journey for all passengers.
A simplified booking experience for Arrows Express, designed by Mauries, Benmar, and Nathan, is a testament to our commitment to innovation and our drive to serve the needs of the DLSU community.
